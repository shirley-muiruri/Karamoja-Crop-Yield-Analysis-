# Karamoja Crop Yield Analysis 
Group 10 project - An analysis of  two crop yields in both districts and subcounties of the Karamoja Region of Uganda

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the yield of two essential staple crops, sorghum and maize, within the Karamoja region of Uganda. The study is conducted at both the district and subcounty levels to offer granular insights into agricultural productivity. This work serves as a foundational step toward developing a food security monitoring tool for NGOs operating in the region.

The project uses satellite imagery-based yield measurements provided by Dalberg Data Insights (DDI). It combines them with demographic and spatial data to support informed decision-making regarding food security interventions.

## Business Problem

Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) is tasked with developing a food security monitoring tool to assist an NGO in Karamoja. This project serves as a preliminary analysis and a "first mockup" for an interactive visualization tool. The goal is to analyze data on sorghum and maize yields to create a prototype for the larger monitoring tool.

## Data

The analysis is based on several datasets provided by DDI, including:
* Crop yield and population data: CSV files containing crop yield and population figures for both districts and subcounties in Karamoja.

* Spatial data: Shapefiles for Uganda's districts and subcounties.

* Crop maps: Shapefiles specifically mapping maize and sorghum cultivation areas.

## Key Findings

* Population density shows a strong correlation with maize cultivation in certain districts.
  
* Overall, sorghum yield remains consistent across the region, but with significant variation at a subcounty level
