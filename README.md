## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the yield of two essential staple crops, sorghum and maize, within the Karamoja region of Uganda. The study is conducted at both the district and subcounty levels to offer granular insights into agricultural productivity. This work serves as a foundational step toward developing a food security monitoring tool for NGOs operating in the region.

The project uses satellite imagery-based yield measurements provided by Dalberg Data Insights (DDI). It combines them with demographic and spatial data to support informed decision-making regarding food security interventions.

## Business Problem

Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) is tasked with developing a food security monitoring tool to assist an NGO in Karamoja. This project serves as a preliminary analysis and a "first mockup" for an interactive visualization tool. The goal is to analyze data on sorghum and maize yields to create a prototype for the larger monitoring tool.

## Data

The analysis is based on several datasets provided by DDI, including:

* Crop yield and population data: CSV files containing crop yield and population figures for both districts and subcounties in Karamoja.

* Spatial data: Shapefiles for Uganda's districts and subcounties.

* Crop maps: Shapefiles specifically mapping maize and sorghum cultivation areas.

## Key Findings

* District Analysis: The map provides a high-level overview of total crop productivity across Karamoja districts. The color intensity indicates the total production of sorghum and maize, allowing us to identify the  most productive areas at a glance. These areas are Kotido, Nakarapiripirit, and Kaabong districts.


  
* Sub-county Analysis: The bar graphs show the relationship between individual crop production, total crop yield, and population. We can conclude that the  majority of the sub-counties have a population higher than their crop yield or production, except for Nakarapiripirit Town Council.


* Crop Analysis: The map visualizes the cultivated areas for both maize and sorghum, revealing which crop is the more dominant in specific sub-counties of Karamoja.


* The map of population vs maize yield per district: It shows high populations in the districts and low maize yields. These areas are prone to facing significant food deficits and should be prioritized for food aid, agricultural support programs, and market interventions.
